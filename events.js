// why some keywords onlu work on web browser like document and window
// and we have to write code in code editor not in web browser so how we can work ?????


//because javascript language is made to be run on web browser console
// we will use react or node.js to use these keyword 
// they will work bacause these language is made to work with servers
const btnss = document.querySelector("h1")

btnss.addEventListener("click",console.log("surya"))
